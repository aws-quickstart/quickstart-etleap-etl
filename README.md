## Etleap ETL on the AWS Cloud

This Quick Start deploys Etleap ETL in a highly available environment on AWS in about 30 minutes.

Etleap offers an extract, transform, and load (ETL) service for building data warehouses using Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) and AWS Glue. Using Etleap on the AWS Cloud, you can extract from any source, including databases, applications, files, and event streams. You can even integrate legacy on-premises sources with no extra effort.

The Quick Start offers two deployment options:

- Deploying ETL into a new virtual private cloud (VPC) on AWS
- Deploying ETL into an existing VPC on AWS

You can also use the AWS CloudFormation templates as a starting point for your own implementation.
